ICOORDSTRANS
============

Software library for geodetical transformations on earth
ellipsoidal surface.

Copyright 2006, Stefanos Kozanis

Library is distributed as a Public Domain software with
no terms.


C code compiles under Microsoft Visual C++ 6. I suppose
that it compiles under any C compiler with few
modifications on the code. A Makefile is included,
I have tested it on a Linux system with gcc.

[Documentation is to be written....]
